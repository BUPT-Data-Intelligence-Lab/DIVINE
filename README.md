# DIVINE: A Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning Framework for Knowledge Graph Reasoning
We present a novel plug-and-play framework based on generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) (Ho and Ermon, 2016) for enhancing existing RL-based methods, which is referred to as DIVINE for “Deep Inference via Imitating Non-human Experts”.
