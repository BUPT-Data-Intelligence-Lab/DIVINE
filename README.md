Code and models for the paper DIVINE: A Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning Framework for Knowledge Graph Reasoning

We present a novel plug-and-play framework based on GAIL (Ho and Ermon, 2016) for enhancing existing RL-based methods, which is referred to as DIVINE for “Deep Inference via Imitating Non-human Experts”.
